So the LED is connected as follows.
    RED → PF1
    BLUE → PF2
    GREEN → PF3

Therefore to display red we need to output 0x02, here '2' because PF0 is not being used. Similarly to display purple/violet → 0x06, blue → 0x04, aqua blue/ greenish blue → 0x0c, green → 0x08, yellow → 0x09, white → 0x0e and none → 0.
